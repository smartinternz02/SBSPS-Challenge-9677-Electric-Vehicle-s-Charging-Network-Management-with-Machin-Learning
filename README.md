# Ev_infrastruture_development_predictor
To accommodate the rising demand for EVs in India, comprehensive charging infrastructure is required. Our solution provides a blueprint for the proper placement of EV stations that should be installed in a particular region by analyzing the current and future need for EV vehicles. People can easily access the website and can look for the nearest EV stations near them.
Project Phoenix basically considers three things in mind while providing the solution:-
1) The minimal distance user has to travel to the EV charging port.
2) Cost of installing EV charging machines.
3) Better prediction of future demands for EV stations over a region.
These things make our solution more feasible and also take into account all the requirements from the perspective of the user and supplier.
